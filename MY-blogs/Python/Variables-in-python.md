# Variables in Python
A **variable** in Python is a name that stores a value. It acts as a container that holds data, which can be changed during program execution.
## Variable Declaration in Python
Unlike some programming languages, Python does not require you to declare a variable type explicitly. You can simply assign a value to a variable.
### **Example:**
```python
# Assigning values to variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
pi = 3.14159

print(name)  # Output: Alice
print(age)   # Output: 25
print(pi)    # Output: 3.14159
```
# Variable Naming Rules
Python variable names must follow these rules:
1. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores ( _ ).
2. Must start with a letter or an underscore ( _ ).
3. Cannot start with a number.
4. Cannot use Python keywords (if, else, while, etc.).
